# Worship Together


Worship Together was a ruby on rails application that we developed together as a class for COS243: Multi-Tier Web Applications. It's a ride sharing application that would allow users to list what church and service they attend. They would, then, mark themselves as being able to transport people to that service, and how many seats in their vehicle they have available to transport. This is one of my first applications with TDD using rspec, and my first exposure to rails.
